	<h2>What is PhoneFinger?</h2>
   
<p>
PhoneFinger turns your Mac's mouse into a realistic simulated human finger for testing and demoing iPhone applications and websites.                
</p> 

<p> Because of the iPhone's high-resolution screen, Apple's iPhone simulator may use an area on your Mac's display that's far larger than an actual iPhone. 
   </p>
	<p>This makes designing and testing user interfaces troublesome. Software that's easy to use with a magnified screen and the precision of a mouse can be near impossible to use on the actual device.
      </p>    
    

	<h2>How do I use it?</h2> 
	<p>Just start up the app. Though intended primarily for iPhone development, PhoneFinger works system-wide and does not require the iPhone SDK.</p>                                      
	
	<h2>How do I customize the appearance of the hand?</h2>
	<p>PhoneFinger uses its own <code>.hand</code> format to bundle hand graphics and related information. In addition to those that are built-in, PhoneFinger will use .hands from <code>~/Library/Application Support/PhoneFinger/Hands</code>.</p>
	<p>To get more hands, or to learn more about how to make your own, visit the <a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/phonefinger/">PhoneFinger website</a>.</p>
