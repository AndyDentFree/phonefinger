In addition to those that are built-in, PhoneFinger will use .hands from <code>~/Library/Application Support/PhoneFinger/Hands</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A .hand file is actually a folder &mdash; you can right-click on it and choose &quot;Show Package Contents&quot; to look inside. Inside of a .hand package are the images the hand uses as well as an Info.plist file. So, to make a hand, just drop all the images and a customized Info.plist into a folder whose name ends with .hand, and drag it into the Hands folder. You'll have to restart PhoneFinger for the hand to show up.</p>\r\n\r\nThe Info.plist can contain the following values:\r\n<dl class=\"plist-guide\">\r\n<dt><code>PFHandName</code></dt>\r\n<dd>The readable name of your hand. Displayed in the hand model menu in the app.</dd>\r\n<dt><code>PFHandAuthor</code><span class=\"opt\">optional</span></dt>\r\n<dd>The person or company responsible for the hand. Not displayed currently.</dd>\r\n<dt><code>PFHandAuthorWebsite</code><span class=\"opt\">optional</span></dt>\r\n<dd>The URL or email associated with the above. Not displayed currently.</dd>\r\n<dt><code>PFHandDescription</code><span class=\"opt\">optional</span></dt>\r\n<dd>A description of the hand. Not displayed currently.</dd>\r\n<dt><code>PFHandVersion</code><span class=\"opt\">optional</span></dt>\r\n<dd>A version number for your hand to distinguish newer versions from older ones.</dd>\r\n<dt><code>PFHandUpImage</code></dt>\r\n<dd>The filename of the image that is displayed when no mouse button is pressed.</dd>\r\n<dt><code>PFHandDownImage</code></dt>\r\n<dd>The filename of the image that is displayed when at least one mouse button is pressed.</dd>\r\n<dt><code>PFHandHotspotX</code></dt>\r\n<dd>The location of the active part of the image (where a click will actually happen) expressed as a number of pixels from the left of the image </dd>\r\n<dt><code>PFHandHotspotY</code></dt>\r\n<dd>The location of the active part of the image (where a click will actually happen) expressed as a number of pixels from the top of the image </dd>\r\n<dt><code>PFHandMinScaleFactor</code><span class=\"opt\">optional</span></dt>\r\n<dd>A number from 0 to 1.0 expressing the ratio to which your image will be scaled when the user selects the smallest size. You must also specify <code>PFHandMaxScaleFactor</code> if you specify this property.</dd>\r\n<dt><code>PFHandMaxScaleFactor</code><span class=\"opt\">optional</span></dt>\r\n<dd>A number from 0 to 1.0 expressing the ratio to which your image will be scaled when the user selects the largest size.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
